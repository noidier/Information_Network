# Network Hub Web App - TODO List

This document outlines key enhancements and future work for the Network Hub Web Application.

## Core Improvements

### Performance and Reliability
- [ ] Add request timeouts to all API handlers
- [ ] Implement proper error handling with graceful degradation
- [ ] Add retry mechanisms for failed operations
- [ ] Implement connection pooling for Hub communication

### UI Enhancements
- [ ] Add real-time updates using WebSockets
- [ ] Implement a more comprehensive dashboard with visual metrics
- [ ] Create a visualization of the hub hierarchy
- [ ] Add dark mode support
- [ ] Improve mobile responsiveness

## HTTP Proxy Integration

The current web app UI includes proxy route management, but lacks actual implementation:

- [ ] Connect the proxy route UI to actual HttpReverseProxy functionality
- [ ] Implement route testing and validation
- [ ] Add metrics collection for proxy routes
- [ ] Implement rate limiting and circuit breaker patterns
- [ ] Add route priority and conflict resolution

## JavaScript Client Support

### Current Limitations
The network-hub-rs library doesn't natively support JavaScript clients due to:

1. No built-in WebSocket or HTTP interfaces that JavaScript could directly connect to
2. Rust-specific message format (using Box<dyn Any>)
3. Lack of cross-language serialization protocol

### Implementation Plan
To enable JavaScript clients to connect to the hub network:

- [ ] Add WebSocket endpoint to the Axum server
   - [ ] Create WebSocket handler for client connections
   - [ ] Implement connection upgrade from HTTP to WebSocket
   - [ ] Design message protocol for JS-Hub communication

- [ ] Create client registration and authentication system
   - [ ] Allow JS clients to register as nodes in the hub network
   - [ ] Implement authentication and session management
   - [ ] Create client hierarchy management

- [ ] Implement message translation layer
   - [ ] Create serialization/deserialization between JS objects and Hub messages
   - [ ] Handle type conversion for common data types
   - [ ] Implement error handling for type mismatches

- [ ] Develop a JavaScript client library
   - [ ] Mirror the Rust API where appropriate
   - [ ] Create WebSocket connection management
   - [ ] Implement request/response handling
   - [ ] Add publish/subscribe pattern support

## Transport Layer Considerations

### Why network-hub-rs Doesn't Use HTTP by Default
1. **Design Philosophy**: Optimized for internal system communication rather than web standards
2. **Performance**: Custom binary protocols can be more efficient than HTTP for internal services
3. **Broader Scope**: Supports various communication patterns (thread-to-thread, process-to-process)
4. **Layered Architecture**: Core Hub functionality is transport-agnostic

### Transport Integration Work
- [ ] Create a robust HTTP transport layer
- [ ] Implement WebSocket transport for real-time communication
- [ ] Add gRPC support for efficient service-to-service communication
- [ ] Implement proper TLS configuration for secure transport
- [ ] Add compression options for network efficiency

## Documentation and Testing

- [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation
- [ ] Document message formats and protocols
- [ ] Create example applications showing various use cases
- [ ] Implement integration tests for all major features
- [ ] Add load testing and performance benchmarks

## Security Enhancements

- [ ] Implement authentication and authorization
- [ ] Add API key management
- [ ] Create role-based access control for API endpoints
- [ ] Implement request validation and sanitization
- [ ] Add audit logging for security events
