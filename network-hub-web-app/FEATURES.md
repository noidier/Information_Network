# Network Hub Web Application Features

This document details the features implemented in the Network Hub Web Application, a web interface for the network-hub-rs library.

## Implemented Features

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Basic web interface using Axum web framework
- ✅ API for registering custom API endpoints with the Hub
- ✅ API for sending requests to registered endpoints
- ✅ Static file serving for web assets
- ✅ CORS support for cross-origin requests

### Hub Integration
- ✅ Integration with the Network Hub's core API system
- ✅ Process-level Hub scope creation and initialization
- ✅ API registration and request handling
- ✅ Automatic hierarchical routing (escalation to parent hubs)

### User Interface
- ✅ Dashboard showing basic hub statistics
- ✅ API management UI for registering new API endpoints
- ✅ API testing UI for sending requests to registered endpoints
- ✅ Responsive design with modern styling

## Partially Implemented Features

### Proxy Functionality
- ⚠️ Basic reverse proxy route configuration UI
- ⚠️ UI for adding and removing proxy routes
- ❌ Actual proxy route implementation (routes are not functional)

### Hub Management
- ⚠️ Viewing API endpoints
- ❌ API removal (not supported by the underlying library)
- ❌ Interception configuration
- ❌ Real-time statistics

## Not Implemented Features

### Advanced Hub Features
- ❌ Message publish/subscribe system UI
- ❌ Hub hierarchy visualization
- ❌ Interceptor registration and management
- ❌ TLS configuration for secure communication
- ❌ Network transport configuration

### Monitoring and Debugging
- ❌ Real-time message monitoring
- ❌ Request/response tracing
- ❌ Hub performance metrics
- ❌ Logging visualization

### Security Features
- ❌ Authentication and authorization
- ❌ API access control
- ❌ Rate limiting
- ❌ User management

## Technical Limitations

1. **API Registry Implementation** - The current Hub implementation does not provide a way to list or remove registered APIs, making the API management UI partially functional.

2. **Proxy Integration** - The UI for managing proxy routes is implemented, but the actual proxy functionality is not connected to the UI.

3. **Hub Hierarchy** - While the Hub automatically connects to parent hubs, there's no way to visualize or manage this hierarchy.

4. **Message System** - The publish/subscribe system exists in the underlying library but is not exposed in the web interface.

## Future Improvements

1. Implement full proxy functionality by integrating with the HttpReverseProxy
2. Add message publishing and subscription management
3. Implement real-time hub statistics and monitoring
4. Add visualizations for the hub hierarchy
5. Add security features including authentication and authorization
6. Implement interceptor configuration through the web interface
