# Virtual Network System with Message Interception

I've designed a concise, internal communication system that can scale from thread-to-process-to-network communication using a consistent protocol. This solution includes a powerful message interception mechanism that allows functions to be overridden by remote services based on priority.

## Core Architecture

The system consists of two main components:

1. **Hub (Rust)** - Central routing and discovery service that operates at thread, process, machine, or network scope
2. **Node libraries (Python/JavaScript/etc.)** - Language-specific client libraries that connect to the hub system

## Key Features Implementation

### Hierarchical Routing

- **Thread → Process → Machine → Network**: Requests automatically cascade through increasing scopes
- Each scope has a "virtualised hub" that manages communication within that boundary
- Requests are resolved at the closest possible scope for optimal performance

### Message Interception System

- **Priority-based interception**: Higher priority handlers can override default behavior
- **Pattern matching**: Subscribe to specific patterns for targeted interception
- **Cross-boundary interception**: Thread functions can be intercepted by other threads/processes

### Function Replacement

- **Method proxying**: Methods can be wrapped with proxies that allow interception
- **Decorators**: Language-specific decorators make methods interceptable
- **Context-aware interception**: Interceptors receive full context about the original call

### Fallback Mechanisms

- **API fallbacks**: Specify alternative paths when services are down
- **Approximation**: Find similar API paths when exact matches aren't found
- **Static mocks**: Define test data that can stand in for unavailable services

## Implementation Details

### Hub Structure (Rust)

The hub manages:
- API registry for service discovery
- Subscriptions for message passing
- Interceptors for function overriding
- Parent/child relationships for hierarchical routing

### Node Library (Python/JavaScript)

The node library provides:
- API registration and calling
- Message publishing and subscription
- Method interception and proxying
- Decorator utilities for making methods interceptable

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: File Search → Web Search Interception

A file search API can be dynamically replaced with a web search:

```javascript
// Register original API
node.registerApi('/search/files', (request) => {
  return { results: [`file:${request.query}_result1`, `file:${request.query}_result2`] };
});

// Register interceptor with higher priority
node.registerInterceptor('/search/files', (message) => {
  if (message.metadata.webRequired === 'true') {
    return { results: [`web:${message.data.query}_result1`, `web:${message.data.query}_result2`] };
  }
  return undefined; // Not intercepted
}, 10);

// Using web search instead of file search
node.publish('/search/files', { query: 'example' }, { webRequired: 'true' });
```

### Example 2: Method Interception

```python
# Define a class with interceptable methods
class FileSearcher:
    @node.intercept()
    def search(self, query):
        return [f'file:{query}_result1', f'file:{query}_result2']

# Register method interceptor
node.register_method_interceptor(FileSearcher, 'search', 
    lambda ctx: web_search(ctx.args[0]) if ctx.args[0].startswith('web:') else None, 
    priority=10)

# Method gets intercepted when appropriate
searcher = FileSearcher()
searcher.search('web:cats')  # Uses web search
searcher.search('cats')      # Uses file search
```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Unified Communication**: Same protocol across all boundaries (thread/process/machine/network)
2. **Lightweight**: Each component is concise and focused
3. **Flexible Overriding**: Priority-based interception enables dynamic behavior modification
4. **Progressive Resolution**: Automatic cascading from local to remote
5. **Language Agnostic**: Core hub in Rust with language-specific bindings
6. **Modular Testing**: Static functions and mocks help with isolated testing

This architecture creates a powerful and flexible communication fabric that allows components to interact seamlessly regardless of their location, with advanced features for dynamic behavior modification through interception.
