# RAG Implementation in Rust - Conversation Summary

## Using RAG from Rust

**Q: Can I use RAG from Rust lang?**

Yes, you can implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using Rust. Rust's performance and safety characteristics make it a good choice for building efficient RAG pipelines.

Approaches:

1. **Use Rust AI/ML libraries**:
   - [rust-bert](https://github.com/guillaume-be/rust-bert) provides Rust bindings for transformer models
   - [candle](https://github.com/huggingface/candle) is Hugging Face's Rust ML framework

2. **Vector database integration**:
   - Connect to vector databases like Qdrant, Milvus, or FAISS using their Rust clients
   - [qdrant-client](https://github.com/qdrant/rust-client) for Qdrant
   - [pgvector-rust](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector-rust) for PostgreSQL with pgvector

3. **Hybrid approaches**:
   - Build retrieval components in Rust for performance
   - Use FFI to connect with Python libraries for the generation component
   - Use REST APIs to connect with hosted LLM services

4. **Full Rust implementations**:
   - Implement embedding generation in Rust
   - Build vector search in Rust
   - Connect to LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) using Rust HTTP clients

A typical RAG workflow in Rust involves:
- Document processing/chunking
- Embedding generation
- Vector storage and retrieval
- Context assembly
- Integration with an LLM (either via API or local model)

## RAG Without Vector Databases

**Q: How feasible is it to use RAG without a vector database?**

It's entirely feasible to implement RAG without a vector database, especially for smaller-scale applications.

Approaches:

1. **In-memory vector search**:
   - Libraries like `faiss-rs` (Rust bindings for FAISS) can run entirely in memory
   - You can implement simple vector similarity search algorithms yourself using dot product, cosine similarity, or other distance metrics

2. **Flat file storage**:
   - Store embeddings in simple file formats (JSON, binary, etc.)
   - Load them into memory at runtime for searching
   - Works well for collections up to tens of thousands of documents

3. **Embedded databases**:
   - SQLite with extensions like `sqlite-vss` for vector similarity search
   - RocksDB or LMDB for key-value storage with custom indexing

4. **Simple data structures**:
   - For small datasets, a simple array of embedding vectors with linear search can be surprisingly effective
   - Implement approximate nearest neighbor search with algorithms like ball trees or locality-sensitive hashing

Considerations:
- **Dataset size**: For under ~10K documents, in-memory solutions work fine
- **Query latency needs**: In-memory approaches can be very fast for smaller datasets
- **Persistence requirements**: Simple file-based storage works if you don't need high write throughput
- **Scaling plans**: Start simple and migrate to a dedicated vector DB when needed

## FAISS in Rust

**Q: What's raiss-rs?**

The correct library is "faiss-rs", not "raiss-rs". 

**faiss-rs** is a Rust binding/wrapper for Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS), which is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. It provides:

1. Efficient nearest neighbor search in vector spaces
2. Various indexing methods for different trade-offs between speed and accuracy
3. Support for GPU acceleration (depending on the implementation)
4. Ability to handle large datasets of embeddings

Alternative Rust implementations of vector search:
- **vpsearch**: A Rust implementation of Vantage Point Trees for nearest neighbor search
- **kiddo**: A K-dimensional tree implementation in Rust for nearest neighbor search
- **annoy-rs**: Rust bindings for Spotify's Annoy (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah) library

## Vector Databases and LLMs

**Q: Do traditional vector databases extract any meaningful data from the LLM, or are their vector models separate?**

Traditional vector databases and LLMs operate as separate components in a typical RAG architecture:

1. **Separate embedding models**: Vector databases don't extract data directly from the LLM. Instead, they store vector embeddings that are typically generated by a dedicated embedding model (like OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002, BERT, or Sentence Transformers).

2. **Independent systems**: The vector database has no direct connection to or knowledge of the LLM's internal representations. It simply stores and retrieves vectors based on similarity.

3. **Division of labor**:
   - Embedding models convert text to vectors
   - Vector databases store and retrieve these vectors efficiently
   - LLMs generate responses using retrieved context

This separation offers flexibility - you can swap out embedding models or LLMs independently, and the vector database remains unchanged as long as the embedding dimensions stay consistent.

Some advanced RAG implementations are starting to blur these lines:
- Systems that use the LLM itself to generate improved embeddings
- Hybrid retrieval approaches that combine vector search with other techniques
- Research into using LLM's internal representations directly for retrieval

## BERT in Rust

**Q: How hard would it be to write a BERT usage in Rust?**

Implementing BERT in Rust would be moderately challenging but definitely doable:

1. **Existing solutions**:
   - The `rust-bert` crate already provides pre-trained BERT models and tokenizers
   - `candle` from Hugging Face offers another implementation path

2. **If building from scratch**:
   - You'd need to understand the transformer architecture
   - Implement tokenization (or use existing tokenizers)
   - Handle model weight loading from standard formats
   - Build the tensor operations (or use existing tensor libraries)

3. **Key components**:
   - Tokenizer implementation or bindings
   - Attention mechanism
   - Feed-forward networks
   - Layer normalization
   - Model weight loading

4. **Complexity factors**:
   - Tensor operations and GPU acceleration are challenging
   - Optimization for performance requires significant effort
   - The model architecture itself is well-documented but complex

Example code using rust-bert:

```rust
// Using rust-bert
use rust_bert::bert::{BertModel, BertConfig};
use rust_bert::resources::RemoteResource;
use rust_bert::Config;
use rust_tokenizers::tokenizer::{BertTokenizer, Tokenizer};
use tch::{nn, Device, Tensor};

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Load pretrained model
    let config_resource = RemoteResource::from_pretrained(BertConfig::resource_id("bert-base-uncased"));
    let vocab_resource = RemoteResource::from_pretrained(BertTokenizer::resource_id("bert-base-uncased"));
    let weights_resource = RemoteResource::from_pretrained(BertModel::resource_id("bert-base-uncased"));
    
    let config = BertConfig::from_file(config_resource.get_local_path()?);
    let tokenizer = BertTokenizer::from_file(vocab_resource.get_local_path()?, true, true)?;
    let bert_model = BertModel::new(&config, weights_resource.get_local_path()?)?;
    
    // Tokenize input
    let input = ["Hello world", "How are you?"];
    let tokenized_input = tokenizer.encode_list(&input, 128, &Default::default(), false)?;
    let max_len = tokenized_input.iter().map(|input| input.token_ids.len()).max().unwrap();
    
    // Convert to tensors
    let tokens_tensor = Tensor::of_slice(&tokenized_input[0].token_ids)
        .view((1, -1))
        .to(Device::Cpu);
    
    // Get embeddings
    let (_, pooled_output, all_hidden_states) = bert_model.forward(&tokens_tensor, None, None, false)?;
    
    println!("Pooled output shape: {:?}", pooled_output.size());
    
    Ok(())
}
```

## PDF Search with Rust-BERT

**Q: How hard would it be to search through a PDF using rust-bert to vectorise the data and search using that knowledge?**

Implementing a PDF search system using Rust-BERT for vectorization is quite feasible:

1. **PDF extraction**:
   - Use a crate like `lopdf` or `pdf-extract` to extract text from PDFs
   - Handle potential challenges like text ordering, formatting, and images

2. **Text chunking**:
   - Split the extracted text into semantic chunks (paragraphs, sections)
   - Implement overlap between chunks to avoid losing context at boundaries

3. **Vectorization with rust-bert**:
   - Use a sentence/paragraph embedding model from rust-bert
   - Generate embeddings for each text chunk

4. **Vector storage and search**:
   - Store embeddings in memory with metadata linking back to PDF positions
   - Implement vector similarity search (cosine similarity is common)

5. **Query processing**:
   - Vectorize user queries using the same model
   - Find similar chunks based on vector similarity
   - Return matching text or PDF locations

Example implementation approach:

```rust
use rust_bert::bert::{BertModel, BertConfig};
use rust_bert::resources::RemoteResource;
use rust_bert::Config;
use rust_tokenizers::tokenizer::{BertTokenizer, Tokenizer};
use tch::{nn, Device, Tensor};
use pdf_extract::extract_text;
use ndarray::{Array1, Array2};

struct DocumentChunk {
    text: String,
    embedding: Array1<f32>,
    page: usize,
    position: (f32, f32), // Approximate position in the PDF
}

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // 1. Extract text from PDF
    let pdf_text = extract_text("document.pdf")?;
    
    // 2. Split into chunks (simplified)
    let chunks: Vec<String> = pdf_text
        .split("\n\n")
        .map(|s| s.trim().to_string())
        .filter(|s| !s.is_empty())
        .collect();
    
    // 3. Load BERT model for embeddings
    let model = load_bert_model()?;
    
    // 4. Generate embeddings for chunks
    let mut document_chunks = Vec::new();
    for (i, chunk) in chunks.iter().enumerate() {
        let embedding = generate_embedding(&model, chunk)?;
        document_chunks.push(DocumentChunk {
            text: chunk.clone(),
            embedding,
            page: i / 10, // Simplified page tracking
            position: (0.0, 0.0), // Simplified positioning
        });
    }
    
    // 5. Process a search query
    let query = "What is the main conclusion?";
    let query_embedding = generate_embedding(&model, query)?;
    
    // 6. Search for similar chunks
    let results = search_similar_chunks(&document_chunks, &query_embedding, 3);
    
    // Display results
    for (chunk, score) in results {
        println!("Score: {:.4}, Page: {}", score, chunk.page);
        println!("{}\n", chunk.text);
    }
    
    Ok(())
}
```

Main challenges:
- PDF text extraction can be messy depending on the PDF structure
- Efficient vector search as your document collection grows
- Mapping search results back to the original PDF locations
- Memory management for large PDFs or document collections

For better performance with larger collections, consider using approximate nearest neighbor algorithms like HNSW (via the `hnsw` crate) or integrating with a lightweight embedded vector database.
